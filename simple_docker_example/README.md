## Introduction

Docker enables you to package your application and its dependencies into a portable, isolated container. This ensures consistent behavior across different environments and simplifies deployment.

## Docker Concepts

This example introduces the following key Docker concepts:

1.  **Base Image Selection:** üß± Choosing the foundation upon which your containerized application will be built. (e.g., `FROM python:3.9-slim-buster`)
2.  **Python Environment Setup:** üêç Configuring the Python runtime environment within the container. (e.g., `WORKDIR /app`)
3.  **Package Installation:** üì¶ Installing the required Python libraries and dependencies for your application. (e.g., `RUN pip install -r requirements.txt`)
4.  **Port Exposure:** üîå Making the application's port accessible from outside the container. (e.g., `EXPOSE 80`)

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the Repository**

2.  **Build the Image:**
    ```bash
    sudo docker build -t my-custom-image .
    ```

3.  **Run the Container:**
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8000:80 my-custom-image
    ```

## Project Structure

-   `Dockerfile`: Contains the instructions for building the Docker image.
-   `app.py`: Your Python application code (replace this with your actual application).
-   `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python packages required for your application.

## Docker Commands Explained

-   **`sudo docker build -t my-custom-image .`:**  Builds an image tagged as "my-custom-image" using the `Dockerfile` in the current directory.
-   **`docker run -p 8000:80 my-custom-image`:** Creates and starts a container, mapping port 8000 on your machine to port 80 within the container.

## Additional Notes

-   This is a basic example. Customize the `Dockerfile` and project files to fit your specific application requirements.
-   Consider using a process manager like Gunicorn for production deployments.
-   Explore advanced Docker features like volumes and networks for more complex scenarios.
